    <p>Do you need to order elements? Do you enjoy casting die? Are you worried about bad/weird actors? Do you abhor fiddling with tunables? If the answer to one or more of these questions is yes, then Alea-BFT is for you!</p>

    <section>
    <h3>What is Alea-BFT?</h3>
    <p>
        Alea-BFT is a BFT (byzantine-fault tolerant) consensus protocol designed for simplicity.
        Unlike other protocols such as <cite><a href="https://entethalliance.org/specs/qbft/v1/">QBFT</a></cite>, which use timeouts to guarantee liveness, Alea is asynchronous.
        Thus, Alea-BFT closely follows network performance while requiring little to no tuning and not stalling on crash faults.
    </p>

    <h3>What is consensus?</h3>
    <p>
        Consensus is an important problem in distributed systems. It consists in having a set of processes propose values and have them all agree on a single proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
        This primitive can be leveraged to build solutions to two other important (and equivalent) problems: total-order broadcast and state machine replication.
        Alea-BFT is technically a total-order broadcast protocol, meaning it concerns itself with deciding a globally-consistent order for an ever-growing set of messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are particularly concerned with BFT consensus, which tolerates byzantine (arbitrary) faults.
        Concretely, we demand that consensus is reached among the correct processes even if some (bounded) amount of processes fail arbitrarily.
    </p>

    <h3>Wait, I thought consensus was impossible in asynchronous networks!</h3>
    <p>
        It is true that consensus, including BFT consensus, is impossible in an asynchonous network if we admit the existence of faults but only if we restrict ourselves to deterministic protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
        Asynchronous consensus protocols like Alea-BFT exploit <em>randomization</em> instead. Concretely, they reframe the termination property of consensus to be probabilistic: consensus terminates with probability 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        This class of protocols was known when the <cite><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3149.214121">FLP impossibility</a></cite> was published.
        Early solutions were simple, arguably simpler than their timeout-reliant counterparts but incurred very high communications.
        Later, <cite><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978399">HoneyBadger-BFT</a></cite> begun a new family of randomized protocols that conquered this inefficiency but still failed to see widespread adoption, plausibly due to their complexity.
        Alea-BFT brings the HoneyBadger-BFT family of protocols and early solutions together to form a simple but efficient protocol.
    </p>

    <section>
    <h3 id="how-alea-works">How Alea-BFT works</h3>
    <p>
        Alea-BFT brings the insight from traditional consensus protocols of centralizing work on a leader.
        However, it sidesteps the challenges associated with this approach (i.e. sensitivity to performance attacks) by only tasking the leaders with conveying their own proposals to the remaining processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Concretely, each leader appends its proposals to a queue, which is replicated to other nodes using a verifiable consistent broadcast.
        Simultaneously, an agreement component constantly tries to deliver the heads of these queues.
        This agreement component progresses in rounds and at every round it 1) picks a queue/proposer and 2) has all processes vote whether to deliver its head using a binary agreement primitive.
