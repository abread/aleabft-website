    <p>Do you need to order elements? Do you enjoy rolling the dice? Are you worried about bad/weird actors? Do you abhor fiddling with tunables? If the answer to one or more of these questions is yes, then Alea-BFT is for you!</p>

    <section>
    <h3>What is Alea-BFT?</h3>
    <p>
        Alea-BFT is a BFT (Byzantine-fault tolerant) consensus protocol designed for performance and simplicity.
        Unlike partially-synchronous protocols such as <cite><a href="https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf">PBFT</a></cite> or <cite><a href="https://entethalliance.org/specs/qbft/v1/">QBFT</a></cite>, which use timeouts to guarantee liveness, Alea is asynchronous, i.e., it does not use predefined timeouts to estimate when a machine might be unresponsive.
        Thus, Alea-BFT closely follows network performance while requiring no tuning of timeout values. Very importantly, Alea-BFT is able to make fast progress, even when the participants or the network are not behaving or performing as expected.
    </p>

    <h3>What is consensus?</h3>
    <p>
        Consensus is an important problem in distributed systems. It consists in having a set of processes propose values and and then agree on a single proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
        This primitive can be leveraged to build solutions to two other important (and equivalent) problems: total-order broadcast and state machine replication.
        (Alea-BFT is designed as a total-order broadcast protocol, but can be easily adapted to the other, related problems.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        The focus of Alea is on BFT consensus, i.e., achieving consensus while tolerating Byzantine (arbitrary) faults.
        Concretely, we require that consensus is reached among the correct processes even if some (bounded) amount of processes fail arbitrarily. The BFT consensus problems is very relevant because it is the core component of important classes of systems, namely blockchains and cryptocurrencies.
    </p>

    <h3>Wait, I thought consensus was impossible in asynchronous networks!</h3>
    <p>
        It is true that consensus, including BFT consensus, is impossible in an asynchronous network if we admit the existence of even a single benign fault (a simple machine crash). (This result is known as the <cite><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3149.214121">FLP impossibility</a></cite>.) However, this only holds if we restrict ourselves to deterministic protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
        Asynchronous consensus protocols like Alea-BFT exploit <em>randomization</em> instead. Concretely, they reframe the termination property of consensus to be probabilistic: consensus terminates with a probability that approaches 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Randomized consensus has been studied for decades, and the initial solutions were very elegant, but incurred in a very high communication cost.
        Alea-BFT brings together insights from these early solutions, more modern asynchronous protocols, and partially-synchronous BFT protocols with fast leader rotation, to form an elegant and efficient protocol.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3 id="how-alea-works">How Alea-BFT works</h3>
    <p>
        Alea-BFT brings the insight of centralizing work on a leader from partially-synchronous consensus protocols.
        However, it sidesteps the challenges associated with this approach (i.e. sensitivity to performance attacks) by only tasking the leaders with conveying their own (locally-ordered) proposals to the remaining processes, leaving the global ordering decision to a leaderless component.
    </p>
    <p>
        Concretely, the protocol is divided into a broadcast component and an agreement component connected by a set of first-in-first-out queues.
        The broadcast component pushes new requests/transactions (fruits in the animation) to the queues using a consistent broadcast primitive: each process appends requests to its respective queue present on all processes.
        Simultaneously, the agreement component progresses in rounds and constantly tries to pop and deliver the heads of these queues.
        At every round, it 1) picks a queue/proposer and 2) has all processes vote on whether to deliver its head using a binary agreement primitive.
        Lastly, if the agreement component votes to deliver a queue whose head is not locally present, the affected process uses a simple recovery protocol to fetch this value from another process.
